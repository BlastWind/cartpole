# Cartpole
OpenAI's cartpole env solver. Code was originally from https://gsurma.github.io I modified it so that I can save weights and load weights

# File descriptions: 
Test.py: 
  You can run test.py to examine how the RL model performs on weights that were trained on 100 steps. 
  You can run cartpole.py to train a new RL model, the weights will be saved to the weights directory.
